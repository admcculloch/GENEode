The geneode.py is the main script that our model is based on that encode the ODE system.
The UQ analysis python file is an example file that generated the uq simulation data based on selected parameters uncertainty.

The UQ analysis usually takes long time to finish given the parameter size and number of samples. Please refer to the simulation data directly under the example folder
